``One of the fundamental problems facing the computer profession today is the considerable
length of time required to develop an effective method of communication with the machine."

\begin{abstract}

The following is a proposal for a computer-oriented intermediate language.
The language is designed to assist in creating understandable
software systems by providing a simple, low-level target for
compilation, emulation and visualization.
Underlying the language is a
minimal RISC-based virtual machine with an unlimited number of strongly-typed registers.
Both the instruction set and the assembly-like language syntax are fairly
traditional, though an effort was made to streamline both.
A small amount of additional syntax and pseudo-instructions were added to achieve
portability across machine architectures and operating systems.
