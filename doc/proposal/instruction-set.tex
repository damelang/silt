\section{Instruction Set}

This section presents a mostly complete description
of the instruction set of the virtual machine.
We leave the binary encoding of instructions unspecified.

\subsection{Arithmetic and Bitwise Operations}

Arithmetic and bitwise instructions have two source operands and
one destination operand. All operands must be the same type.
The source operands must be two registers or one register and one literal.
Bitwise and unsigned arithmetic instructions cannot be applied to
floating point registers. For a list of these instructions,
see Table \ref{ArithmeticAndBitwiseInstructions}.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
      \hline
      ADD  & Addition               \\ \hline
      SUB  & Subtraction            \\ \hline
      MUL  & Multiplication         \\ \hline
      DIV  & Division               \\ \hline
      UDIV & Unsigned division      \\ \hline
      REM  & Remainder              \\ \hline
      UREM & Unsigned remainder     \\ \hline
      AND  & Logical conjunction     \\ \hline
      OR   & Logical disjunction    \\ \hline
      XOR  & Exclusive disjunction  \\ \hline
      SHL  & Bit shift left         \\ \hline
      SHR  & Bit shift right        \\ \hline
      ASHR & Arithmetic shift right \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

Example instructions:

\begin{verbatim}
    ADD %i1 %i2  -> %i1
    MUL %f5 0.5  -> %f6
    AND %b3 0x0F -> %b3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Copying to a Register}

The \texttt{COPY} instruction is used to copy a value into
a register. The source operand may be another register,
a literal value, or a label, in which case the address
the label refers to is copied into the destination operand.
The destination operand must have the same type as the source operand.
The \texttt{COPY} instruction does not read or write from memory.

\begin{verbatim}
    COPY %i1  -> %i2
    COPY 0x00 -> %b9
    COPY var1 -> %w2
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Memory Access}

The \texttt{LOAD} instruction reads the value in memory
at the address given by the source operand. The source operand
must be a word register or a label.

The \texttt{STORE} instruction writes the value given by
the first operand into the memory address given by the
second operand. The second operand must be a word register
or a label.

\begin{verbatim}
    LOAD %w3  -> %s1
    LOAD var1 -> %w1
    STORE %i2 %w6
    STORE 0x00 %w1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Control Flow}

An unconditional branch is performed using the \texttt{JUMP} instruction, which
takes a local label its only operand.

\begin{verbatim}
    JUMP loop
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{COMP} instruction compares two values and sets condition flags
accordingly in an implicit status register. Subsequent conditional branch instructions of the
form \texttt{JUMP*} use the flags to determine program flow.

\begin{verbatim}
    COMP  %f4 1.0
    JUMP< label3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Conversion}

Conversion between data types is provided by the
\texttt{CONV} instruction.

\begin{verbatim}
    CONV %i3 -> %f1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Stack Memory Allocation}

The \texttt{ALLOC} pseudo-instruction allocates memory
on the stack. The source operand
specifies the amount of memory to allocate in bytes,
and must be a literal integer. The destination operand, which must
be a word register, receives the start address of the
allocated memory.

\begin{verbatim}
    ALLOC 0x1 -> %w4
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Function Calling}

The \texttt{CALL} pseudo-instruction provides a platform-independent
mechanism for calling a function. The first operand must be
a label or a word register. Zero or more function arguments follow,
all of which must be registers. Return values, if any, are received
by destination registers.
The assembler does not check that argument types match those
in the function definition.

\begin{verbatim}
    CALL getNameForId %i3 -> %w2
    CALL puts %w2
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{RETURN} pseudo-instruction is used to return program
control, and optionally values also, to the calling function.

\begin{verbatim}
    RETURN %d2
\end{verbatim}

In the future, an additional pseudo-instruction \texttt{SYSCALL}
may be defined for interfacing with the operating system.
For functional programming, a \texttt{TAILCALL} pseudo-instruction
could also be defined.

\subsection{Platform-Specific Data Layout}

In some cases, interfacing with code generated by a C compiler
requires laying out data in memory according to the
underlying machine word width and operating system ABI.
This need arises when calling a C function that accepts
a pointer to a structure as an argument.
To this end, the \texttt{PACK} pseudo-instruction takes a list
of source registers, allocates an appropriate amount of stack memory,
and copies the register values to the allocated space according
to rules of the target platform. The \texttt{UNPACK} pseudo-instruction
does the reverse.

\begin{verbatim}
    PACK %b4 %w2 %i1 -> %w5
    CALL func %w5
    UNPACK %w5 -> %b4 %w2 %i1
\end{verbatim}
